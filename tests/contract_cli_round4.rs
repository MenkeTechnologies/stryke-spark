//! Round 4 integration tests pinned the v1 helper-binary CLI contract
//! (`stryke-spark-helper --help`, exit codes, subcommand routing).
//!
//! v0.2.0 retired that binary in favor of an in-process cdylib loaded by
//! stryke via dlopen — there is no longer a CLI surface to contract-test.
//! The exports are exercised end-to-end by `t/test_spark.stk`.
//!
//! This file is preserved (per repo convention: never delete test files)
//! and replaced with a single sanity test so `cargo test` stays green.
